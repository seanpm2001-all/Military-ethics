# War Machines

I cannot build machines of war. I want war to end, as conflict always leads to further conflict. I have gotten ideas in the past, but have not gone through with them. I am a pacifist.

This list shows the types of machines and war machines I can and can't build, and why. The list is incomplete.

## Mechs

I don't consider Mechs to be weapons of war, unless they have an added weapon. I find mechs cool, and am able to program them if needed, although I won't build a mech that shoots innocent people, or someone the user opposes.

## Turrets

Automated turrets are a cool thing to me, but I don't like having a security element of my life, there shouldn't have to be one. I can program certain non-lethal turrets, I am currently considering a salt turret that shoots down flies.

## Tanks and body armor

I obviously am not going to build any tanks, but I have been considering body armor lately.

## More coming soon
